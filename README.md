# Pokedex

Pokedex by Pavel Gasanov

## Description

* SPA React application.
* Minimal extra dependencies - only 3
* Typescript
* Jest unit testing
* `graphql-request` as minimal GraphQL library
* `chart.js` as simple data visualization library
* `react-pagination` to implement list pagination
* GitHub action to run tests

Filtering done on frontend. Whole data size is ~55kb and will not increase in near future, so priority is user experience - no data reloading.

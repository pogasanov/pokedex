## Developer Projects

We have many different roles at Our company ranging from backend developer to machine learning to product designer. As such, we have different assignments for the different roles.

### Frontend Developers

Our project for frontend developers involves building a small, single web page application (SPA) using React. Your SPA should make use of the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/) which is fully annotated [here](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2). Essentially, we want you to build a small [Pokedex](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9dex) in which you can perform certain basic searching and rendering of the data. We are looking for clean, organized code and a crisp UI experience that would make any Product Designer proud of your skills.

We are big believers in testing and continuous integration. As such, we want you to add linting, unit tests and integration tests to a CI pipeline.

#### Project Requirements

- Built in React and TypeScript.
- Contain both Unit and Integration Tests.
- Has some form of CI/CD pipeline with linting, tests, and deployment.
- Write an informative and descriptive README explaining what you built, why you built it, how to set it up, and how to use it.

#### Bonus

- Build a GraphQL server using the REST Poke API.
- Any sort of implementation of Data Visualization.

#### High-Level User Stories to Cover

**User Story 1**: As a Pokemon fan, I would like to search a catalog of Pokemon characters (Pokedex) by their name or by some of the characters in their name in order to return one or more Pokemon and their trading card attributes.

**User Story 2**: As a Pokemon fan, I would like know how many (count) unique Pokemon are in the Pokedex, as well as unique Pokemon Types and Pokemon Species.

**User Story 3**: As a Pokemon fan, I would like to filter and narrow my search criteria based on Pokemon Type and Pokemon Species.

**User Story 4**: As a Pokemon fan, I would like to see pictures of the Pokemon characters with some identifying attributes (trading card information) about the creatures presented in the screen.

**User Story 5**: As a Pokemon fan, I would like to sort the order of the Pokemon characters based on one or more identifying attributes about the character.
